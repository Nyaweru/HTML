        <h1>ELDORET TOWN</h1>
        <h2>HOME OF CHAMPIONS</h2>
        <h3><font color="blue">Capital of Uasin Gishu County</font></h3>
        <p>The town was referred to by white settlers as Farm 64 and colloquially by locals as 'Sisibo'.
            
            Eldoret is the fifth most populated urban area in the country after Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Ruiru. 
            Lying south of the Cherangani Hills, the local elevation varies from about 2,100 metres (6,900 ft) at the airport to more than 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) in nearby areas. 
            The population was 289,380 in the 2009 Census and it is currently the fastest growing town in Kenya with 475,716 people according to 2019 National Census.
             Eldoret was on course to be named Kenya's fourth city, but was edged out by Nakuru in 2021.</p>

    <p> Eldoret is known for its beautiful natural scenery, including Chepkiit Waterfall and Chororget Church Rock View Point 4.

        The town's economy is mainly dependent on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Uasin Gishu County, where Eldoret is located, is regarded as Kenya's breadbasket due to its large-scale grain farming (maize and wheat), dairy, and horticultural farming 56.</p>
